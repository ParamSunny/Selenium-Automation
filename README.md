# Selenium-Automation
## Project Overview
SeleniumAutomation is a **smart Selenium automation tool** designed to streamline the outreach process by auto-filling and submitting messages via "Contact Us" forms on websites. This project is tailored for automating direct communication with target companies, eliminating the need for manual submissions.

## ✨ Key Features:-
• Automates navigation to a website's contact form

• Automatically fills out required fields like name, email, and message

• Simulates human-like interaction to avoid detection

• Ideal for marketing, outreach, lead generation, or support requests

• Clean and modular Java codebase using Maven and Selenium WebDriver

## 🧰 Built With:-
• Java

• Selenium WebDriver

• Maven

• ChromeDriver

## 📁 Project Structure:-
• src/main: Core automation logic

• pom.xml: Maven configuration

• .gitignore, .idea: Project config files

## 🚦How It Works:-
• Launches a browser session using ChromeDriver

• Navigates to a target website’s contact page

• Fills in name, email, subject, and message

• Submits the form and logs status

## 💡 What Makes It Unique:-
Unlike traditional bulk email tools, this bot interacts directly with company websites, improving message delivery and personalization. It mimics human input, making it harder to detect as a bot.
